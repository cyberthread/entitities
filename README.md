# Challenge: HTML Entities
This assignment is to practice adding HTML entities and symbols into your HTML, as well as to practice using inline text semantics.

There are two references you might find particularly helpful with this challenge:
- [Typewolf's Typography Cheatsheet](https://www.typewolf.com/cheatsheet) to easily reference HTML entity codes and when to use those entities.
- [MDN's HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to look up HTML tags that are used to markup inline text to define the meaning and purpose of individual letters, words or phrases in the content.

## Hints
You'll need the following HTML tags:
- abbr
- time
- q

You'll need to address the following symbols, characters and punctuation:
- em dash
- en dash
- ellipsis
- fraction
- accented and non-English characters
- math symbols
- copyright symbol
- single quotes

In total there are 29 inline text semantics instances that require additional HTML tags and 19 cases where you'll need to replace what is in the content with an HTML entity.

### Requirements
- You each have your own repository, but you can work collaboratively and only need to submit the URL of one repository.
- You do not need to make this live.
- This activity is timed; do what you can in the time frame.
- When time is up the TA will look at your code and verify how many instances your team found. You will submit the verified number of instances and the URL to the repository in Blackboard to get credit for this assignment.
